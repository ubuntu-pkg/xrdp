 xrdp may be redistributed under the terms of the GNU GPL, Version 2 or
 later, found on Debian systems in the file
 `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2`, with a few exception allowing the use
 of OpenSSL and allowing to link with proprietary modules. Those
 exceptions are reproduced below:

 8<-----------------------------------------------------------------
 special clause for libxrdp and librdp, both based on rdesktop
 these libraries link to openssl

  This software is released under the GNU General Public License
  (reproduced below) with the additional exemption that compiling,
  linking, and/or using OpenSSL together with this software is
  allowed.

 special clause for xrdp, that main executable
 for linking with proprietary modules

  Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules
  is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms
  and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole
  combination.

  As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library
  give you permission to link this library with independent modules
  to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of
  these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
  executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet,
  for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the
  license of that module. An independent module is a module which is
  not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this
  library, you may extend this exception to your version of the
  library, but you are not obliged to do so. If you do not wish
  to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
